									<h1>The Resolution Dependence of Cloud-Wind Simulations</h1>
								</header>
									<h2>Background</h2>

									<p>Galactic winds are very important for enriching the metallicity of the circumgalactic 
										medium (CGM) and for regulating the star formation rates of the galaxy. These winds are 
										observed to be multiphase, consisting of gas at a wide range of densities and temperatures. 
										These winds can be moving at speeds of hundreds of km/s. The majority of the windâ€™s volume is 
										made up of hot, ionized gas (about 10^7 K) and the majority of the mass is made up of cold 
										clumps of gas (10^4 K). What has been of interest to astronomers is how the cool
										clouds accelerate to become comoving with the wind.</p>
									<p>Modeling the interaction between a cool cloud and a hot, fast wind has historically 
										faced challenges. Computer simulations in the past have ended with the cold phase of gas heating up and 
										getting destroyed rather than accelerated and entrained in the wind. This is caused by hydrodynamic 
										instabilities like the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. 
										Cosmological simulations are incapable of resolving these small-scale processes.</p>
									<p>More recently, however, researchers have had success in modeling the acceleration of the 
										clouds with the implementation of radiative cooling. At the small scale, the KH 
										instability will cause mixing to occur in the shear layer between the cloud and wind, and this 
										mixing layer will have an intermediate temperature. Radiative cooling is most efficient at this 
										intermediate temperature, so the mixing layer's mass cools and accretes onto the cloud. With this 
										model, cool clouds can actually grow in mass and reach the velocity of the background wind, becoming 
										entrained.</p>

										</div>
									<p>This model has been very successful, but has not been explored at high resolutions 
										due to the simulations being very computationally expensive.
										These simulations consist of a three dimensional box with a fixed number of cells in the x, y, and z 
										directions. As you increase the resolution, you increase the number of cells spanning
										the cloud and mixing layer. A better resolved mixing layer could lead to faster 
										mixing and cooling. Therefore, the
										effectiveness of the radiative cooling model may be dependent on the resolution of the simulation. 
										</p>
									<h2>Project Overview</h2>
									<p>My research aims to quantify this relationship between the resolution of the 
										simulaions and the cloud's acceleration and survival. Determining possible 
										effects of resolution will help decide if this mixing and cooling model is sufficient 
										for modeling cool cloud acceleration in galactic winds, or if other physical
										mechanisms such as cosmic rays or magnetic fields is necessary. 
										In order to study this relationship, I run cloud-wind simulations on 
										GPU nodes on the CRC supercomputer using 
										<a href="https://github.com/cholla-hydro/cholla" >Cholla</a>. Cholla is a 
										GPU-based hydrodynamics code that is massively parallel, so it is able to efficiently 
										run very high resolution simulations.
